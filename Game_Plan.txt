Things to do:

Decide whether we're going to do pixel (resolution) upsampling, dwell time (counts) upsampling, as well potentially
SED image upsampling

Decide on architecture we want to use for the model

Think about how to do hyperparameter optimization train/dev/test split, etc

Think about what makes the most sense for data augmentation. Currently doing cropping beforehand, followed by
keras realtime data augmentation for flipping. Could make sense to generate additional, artifical training data,
with 2x2 averaging eg if we do pixel downsampling.

Think about what baseline comparison model is going to be
