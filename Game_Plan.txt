Things to do:

Implement data preprocessing

Decide whether we're going to do pixel (resolution) upsampling, dwell time (counts) upsampling, as well potentially
SED image upsampling

Decide on architecture we want to use for the model

Think about how to do hyperparameter optimization train/dev/test split, etc

Think about what makes the most sense for data augmentation
    This will likely be model specific. For certain cases may be able to create artifical training data

Think about what baseline model is going to be
